# Code of Conduct

## How We Work

Good work with good people. No ego. No politics.

## What We Value

**Respect time.** Yours and others'. No pings for things that can wait. No meetings that should be emails. No emails that should be nothing.

**Respect ideas.** Big ideas come from every corner. Disagree directly, not behind backs. Attack problems, not people.

**Ship, don't deck.** Working code beats presentations. Prototypes beat proposals. Show your work.

**Fail loudly.** In testing, not production. Share context, not just tasks. If something breaks, say so. We fix faster when we know faster.

**Protect focus.** Deep work matters. Interruptions kill good software. Be async by default.

## What We Don't Do

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Gatekeeping or territorial behavior
- Jargon to sound smart
- Politics over product

## Enforcement

Violations get addressed directly. Repeat issues mean you're out.
