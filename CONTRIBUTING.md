# Contributing to Surmado API Examples

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an issue first.** Describe what you want to add or fix.
2. Wait for approval before submitting a PR.
3. Keep changes minimal and focused.

## What We Accept

- Bug fixes in example code
- New language examples (Go, Ruby, PHP, etc.)
- Documentation improvements
- Integration guides (Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.)

## What We Don't Accept

- Changes to JSON schemas (these match our API contract)
- Marketing or promotional content
- Speculative features (email us about those!)

## Code Style

- Keep examples minimal. Developers want copy-paste, not boilerplate.

- Test your examples before submitting
